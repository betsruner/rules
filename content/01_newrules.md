### [<u>`vm_debug` is banned</u>](https://discord.com/channels/146404426746167296/636786123091345438/1352006194910466068)

> `vm_debug` is no longer an allowed console command. This was our justification for
> allowing decimal precision from 3-6 decimals, which are no longer allowed. As such,
> `sar_hud_precision` can only be at a value of 2 or less.
>
> Note that this does not apply to the [Least Portals category](https://lp.portal2.sr),
> where precision is still allowed to be 3-6 decimals.
