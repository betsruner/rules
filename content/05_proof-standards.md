## Proof Standards

Unless otherwise noted in category rules, all runs most have some form of proof
associated with them, which could be in the form of a video or of demo(s). Most
categories will require demo proof for runs above a certain rank. Demos are generally
encouraged over videos as they have several tangible advantages.

Videos submitted as proof must have an accepted timer visible on the screen. They must
always be submitted as a single continuous video, they must not have any severe quality
or framerate issues which impact viewability, and they must not be uploaded to any
suspicious websites.

Demos must be submitted for every segment of the run, in the correct order, with none
missing. You must start recording demos before the run begins where possible, or
otherwise as soon as you can - it is recommended to use `sar_record_at` to achieve this.
On runs with multiple segments, demos must be recorded across loads - this is normally
expected to be achieved via the `sar_autorecord` command, but categories may define
different methods.

The only websites allowed for uploading demos are Google Drive, and Mediafire.
If you can't meet this requirement due to restrictions in your country then please
request a waiver from a Moderator. We do not want anyone to have to make a purchase
in order to submit their speedrun. Waivers will only be given out to those who cannot
access these sites without an additional cost.

For any category other than Challenge Mode, any custom `.vpk` files active
during the run must be included in the run submission. They can be uploaded to a
site such as Google Drive along with the demo files.
